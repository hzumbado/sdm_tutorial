In this repository, I will provide materials to conduct a species distribution model (climatic suitability map) for the gliding tree frog Agalychnis spurrelli. I will start using with maxent with tuned settings but will continue adding more approaches. This is only an example of the most important modeling steps, and the results do not show a final publishable product. Nonetheless, all steps follow a logic order and show approaches to prepare and model the data correctly.
