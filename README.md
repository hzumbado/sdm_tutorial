In this repository, I will provide materials to conduct a species distribution model (climatic suitability map) for the gliding tree frog Agalychnis spurrelli. I will start using Maxent with tuned settings but will continue adding more approaches. This is only an example of the most important modeling steps, and the results do not show a final publishable product. Nonetheless, all steps follow a logical order and show approaches to prepare and model the data correctly.
