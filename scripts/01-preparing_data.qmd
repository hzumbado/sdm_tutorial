First we will get some occurrence data from two global datasets: GBIF and INaturalist. We will use different tools to make sure the occurrence records are reliable. We will use functions from the tidyverse package to prepare the data and the packages sf and tmap to map and evaluate occurrences. To avoid any conflict with functions that have the same name, make sure to load tidyverse as the last package.

```{r}

#| label: load-package
#| include: true
#| message: false

library(rgbif)
library(rinat)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
